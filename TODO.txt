1. User Study
	Run study
	Analyze data
	Finish figure
	Edit text
2. Collect Demo Documentation
	Pictures: Cole Images
	Videos: Cole Interactive Demos
3. Edit Manuscript
	Figures:
		Fig 1:
			Make color red used for light more vibrant
			Remove "user" label
			Remove first frame from subfig C (make light easier to see)
			Have high-level device archetecture as subfig D (tactile video synthesis)
				Image-> visual display -> light -> ...
				optocouple circuit -> control signal -> ...
				amplification -> actuator driving signal - > ...
				actuator -> tactile pattern
		Fig 3
			Put space on top (break out single actuator for time)
			Put figure A on bottom (larger time arrow)
	Text:
		Abstract
			See yon comments in text
		Section I
			Look for literature outside of haptics (chat gpt deep research)
		Section II
			First describe high-level system and highlight advantages
				Parrallel control
					Scalable
				No drivers
				Modularity (mulitple devices, etc.)
		General
			Unify language 
				impulse, energy, skin displacement, ect.
				optocoupled driving circuit
				Remove "LightTouch"
				change U to T for kinetic energy in figures
