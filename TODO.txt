TODO:

1. Order other inductors
	Get samples from Codaca
2. Determine forces produced in version 3
	COMSOL
	Measurements
	Compare 2 vs 1 magnet stack
3. Solve bottoming out issues
	Touch surface to prevent finger from pressing magnet too far down
	Analyze stable equilibrium points
4. Construct upgraded version
	Different spring (better manufacturing)
	3D-printed tactor
	Touch surface
	Thinner plates?
4. Meet with Yon to show prototype
5. Magnetic shielding
6. Electrical system
	New Inductors
	3x3 Array


Contingency Plans:
	Look at Magnets with 3mm diameter
	Look at Inductors 29 and 30
