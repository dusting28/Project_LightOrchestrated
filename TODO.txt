TODO:

1. Design
	Driving signal electronics
		Capacitive buffering
		Blow fuse

2. Characterization
	Thermal Data
		Fit Data
	Mechanical Data
		Determine light intensity from LED
		Measure moving mass (scale in Carlini lab)
		Recapture data (24V? and new heat sink / linear guide)
			Gate voltate, inductor current, inductor voltage?, displacement, velocity (LDV)?
		Recapture quasi-static forces with 24 V

3. Fabrication
	10x10 Testing
		Add elastic elements
		Fabricate thermal pads (buy on digikey)
		Assemble whole system
	Assemble pulsed electronic system
		
4. User Study
	Finish monitor stand
	Stage photos of potential applications
