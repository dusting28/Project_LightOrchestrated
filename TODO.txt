TODO:

1. Design
	Determine what to do about mechanical stop (elastic element)
	Determine what to do about tactor / touch surface
	Driving signal electronics

2. Characterization
	Proportial Control
		Determine light intensity from LED
		Measure voltage for control signal
		Measure current across inductor
		Measure actuator displacement
	Thermal analysis
		500 ms pulse (compare new heat sink to old)
		Continuous pulses (with and without heat sink)

3. 10x10 Array Fabrication
	Fabricate linear guide
	Fabricate optical cavity (couple to monitor)
	Add mechanical stops
	Solder green connectors
	Assemble magnets/tactors
	Assemble whole system
	
4. User Study
	Stage photos of potential applications
